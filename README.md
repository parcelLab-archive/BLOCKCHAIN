# Called It 🏅 

## Todos

- [ ] Add amount of calls to Smart Contract (and probably other getters and setters)

- [ ] Mapping address ~> call ids 

- [ ] Events that a new call has been called and a called call is actually called, like for realz

- [ ] Limitations on number of calls per day per address (and maybe other limitations as well, but the good kind)

- [ ] Super sexy frontend to call something, to list all your calls, to mark your calls as happened and to see other's calls (that have been announced or even happened) as well

- [x] Update the web site at calledit.io

### How it works in 3 magical steps

#### 1) Call it 
You just know that something will happen? Croatia will win the World Cup? Trump will be impeached by September? Call it and make it official.

#### 2) Blockchain Magic 
Your calls are immutably and irreversibly stored forever to the Etherum Blockchain.

#### 3) Praise & Glory 
It happened and you called it! Oh man, the feeling! You're king of the hill, the sun is brighter, you look better than ever and the world is your oyster.

### Try it (you know you wanna)

You'll need to have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or any other way to interact with a smart contract plus a lot of knowledge on Etherum. So just install MetaMask, transfer some funds to your wallet and check out our web app:

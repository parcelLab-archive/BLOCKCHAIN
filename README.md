# BLOCKCHAIN

> Called It 🏅 more info at [calledit.io](https://calledit.io)

## Todos

- [ ] Add amount of calls to Smart Contract (and probably other getters and setters)

- [ ] Mapping address ~> call ids 

- [ ] Events that a new call has been called and a called call is actually called, like for realz

- [ ] Limitations on number of calls per day per address (and maybe other limitations as well, but the good kind)

- [ ] Super sexy frontend to call something, to list all your calls, to mark your calls as happened and to see other's calls (that have been announced or even happened) as well
